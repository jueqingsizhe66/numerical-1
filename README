Numerical

This repository contains small exercises, snippets, ... dealing with numerical computations. Most of them are written and executed using Octave, which should be almost compatible with Matlab.

This repository was started when I took the Numerical Computations course at the Catholic University of Leuven. The Matlab exercises I had to do during that course are collected in the kul/ directory.
